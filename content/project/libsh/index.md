Over the years of working with Linux, I have found myself always trying to recall how to install something, or do
an action, or setting just the correct environment variables in a certain file. After a while, I got tired and
decided to start collecting small functions to this for me. ZSH also helped in allowing to use the TAB button
for doing auto-complete of functions and variables.

1. sorting of features
2. documenting of command examples
3. refreshing due to drift
4. validating environments
5. supporting personal and professional environments
6. getting in front of the prompt for annoucements
