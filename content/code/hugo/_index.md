## overview

Hugo makes for generating a static site with GoLang. This site is managed by Hugo
and a theme called Academic. While making these entries is pretty straight forward,
the task for remembering the right command always escapes me each time. So making
an entry to document the options seemed most fitting for my note taking.

I found this really cool [project allows commenting with github issues for commenting](https://utteranc.es/).
Some day I will install it, but for now I am good.
