Building software or just files in general has been done for along time with Makefile.
It has been around for ever and seldom gets any changes because its really just a
finished product. Yes sometimes the syntax is funky, but it works in a very consistant
format and supports compiling very complex projects or even basic execution.

My goal for this area is to hold any notes or suggestions about the Makefile for a
reference.
