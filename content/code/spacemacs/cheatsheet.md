## Editing

### CodeBlock

When you have a code block in a `org-mode` file, that looks like the one below, you can use `C-c '` to edit the contents of the code block in a separate buffer. This makings for alignment and language rules much easier to handle.

To get back to the previous buffer area, there are two possible commands that you could use which are based on where you came from.
If you are in org-mode file, use the instructions at the top of the buffer.

If you are in a markdown (or other file that supports embedded syntax language), then use `C-c '`
