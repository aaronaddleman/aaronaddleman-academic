Selecting versions of the tools used makes for much less frustration and improved experimentation. Totally agree you can do this
with containers, but you will be moving away from your editor. I am all for testing our inside containers as much as possible,
but understanding how to build the version compatablilty is also important. I highly encourage you to use the features of
VSCode and container attachment if you are familiure with this or want to explore how it works. If you are new to this idea
here is a short summary: VSCode allows you to attach to containers and modify files.
