I have used Vim for a really long time. Probably the first editor that made sense after using `ex` or `ed`. Sure there are many others
but Vim has always been there for me when I was installing different Operating Systems. Yes, its totally possible I just made some visitors
that come to this site really frustrated because they love Emacs. To you I will say:

> The best editor is the one you are most comfortable with

This is my learnings for Vim and how I have used it over the years to help manage it better. Not a entry on how to use Vim itself. There
are plenty of tutorials on how to learn and practive Vim.

## Plugin Managers

[Googling the best vim plugins](https://www.google.com/search?q=best+vim+plugin+manager&rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS938US938&oq=best+vim+plugin+ma&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l3j0i22i30j69i64.5327j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) resulted in finding the [stackexchange article about what are the differeneces between vim plugin managers](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/388/what-are-the-differences-between-the-vim-plugin-managers)

I have usually gone for [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) but I have also tried a couple others. Your milage may vary. Just pick one
instead of doing the work manually... unless you really want to work harder, in which case, ^5 to you.

## https://spacevim.org/

I did try this project out, but they have catered more to Vim side of things and not the Emacs of things (for very obvious reasons). This has left me
a little confused and having to learn lots of keys that are am not familiure with when coming from Spacemacs.

Still a great project and I know a couple of people who really enjoy it very much.
