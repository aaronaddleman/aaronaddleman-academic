## Summary

GPG/PGP keys are great. Encryption...hiding things...all good stuff from prying eyes. Configuring and keeping updated with the changes is annoying. This brings us to this document.

## Listing keys

```shell
gpg --list-keys
```

Should show the following output. Take note that the 0's are to avoid outdated information:

Listing the signatures allows for showing the short form of the key id:

```
gpg --list-signatures
```

## Tools for macOS

I like the GPG Tools suite over at https://gpgtools.org/ they are really handy and monitor the clipboard for any keys that exist. When you copy a private or public key while the application is open will prompt for importing.
