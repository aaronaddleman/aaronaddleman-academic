## Summary 

Continuing on with my experiments of CDKTF, this time with the Python language and wow, there is much more improved documentation compared to TypeScript. Maybe I am missing something about TypeScript, but the docs are super sparse. Anyways readon to see how I repeat the same steps from my other article of [CdkTf Trials with TypeScript](/post/cdktf-trials-with-typescript).
