* OrgMode Blogging
  This is the best thing I have seen in a really long time with regards to OrgMode and blogging. I have
tried many thing things in the past with OrgMode and posting articles to various services which usually they end up breaking, getting
deprecated, or are just confusing. This is simple. Make an *_index.org* file with some frontmatter at
the top and you are good to go!

** Frontmatter

   Here is the example frontmatter of this document that sets some basic fields that are similar
to the markdown frontmatter.

** Why do it?

   Eazy. OrgMode brings lots of features to editing notes in a text format. Can make a very easy argument
about how text files will be supported for ever. This is the same for MarkDown, but OrgMode has way more
features geared towards making outlines, tasks, links, topics, and even executing code to insert the results
within the document. Oh and its just super fun. The organization tools of OrgMode... to blog? How could you
turn that down?

** Tables
   Lets show of some tables. I just absolutly love how OrgMode makes composing tables so easy.

 #+CAPTION: This is my caption
 | Key | Value                |
 |-----+----------------------+
 | 1,2 | Jim Butters was here |

 #+PLOT: title:"Citas" ind:1 deps:(3) type:2d with:histograms set:"yrange [0:]"
 | Sede      | Max cites | H-index |
 |-----------+-----------+---------|
 | Chile     |    257.72 |   21.39 |
 | Leeds     |    165.77 |   19.68 |
 | Sao Paolo |     71.00 |   11.50 |
 | Stockholm |    134.19 |   14.33 |
 | Morelia   |    257.56 |   17.67 |

** Dates
   Inserting and keeping track of dates is a new thing to me for OrgMode, but I have seen plenty of examles
which show that tracking things inside OrgMode can be quite rewarding.

#+BEGIN_SRC
   DEADLINE: <2021-05-10 Mon>
<2021-05-10 Mon>
#+END_SRC

** src code

   Adding source code and its output just makes for really great blogging.
   The idea of having both with less copy+paste is much better in my
   opinion.

   #+BEGIN_SRC
    \#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
      def hello_world():
        return "Make a better hello world example"

      response = hello_world()

      print(response)
    \#+END_SRC

    \#+RESULTS:
    : Make a better hello world example
   #+END_SRC

** Reveal.js
   Exporting this post to a Reveal.js presentation could not be more simple. Yes, it makes an html file.
   Add some reveal.js and you have a really great show to put on. Just add the following to the properties
   section and download the [https://revealjs.com/installation/][Reveal.js]

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   #+REVEAL_ROOT: file://./assets/reveal.js-master
   #+END_SRC

** Formating

   Oh where oh where do I begin? We have all the things that you =could= _possibly_ /think/ of _/and then/_
   some more.

   The radius of the sun is R_sun = 6.96 x 10^8 m.  On the other hand,
   the radius of Alpha Centauri is R_{Alpha Centauri} = 1.28 x R_{sun}.

   Pro tip: Given a circle \Gamma of diameter d, the length of its
   circumference is \pi{}d.

   - terms :: are just a nice way to give organization

   Lets show off some images too.

   #+CAPTION: This is the caption for the next figure link (or table)
   #+NAME:   fig:SED-HR4049
   [[featured.jpg]]

   Keep going? What about captions??

   #+CAPTION: This is the caption for the next table (or link)
    | First Name | Last Name |
    |------------+-----------|
    | Mr.        | Anderson  |
    | Captain    | America   |
    | Bruce      | Banner    |

** Quotes

   Finally, quotes. This almost everything you can do with OrgMode and formatting with
   Hugo, which really shows most popular things that I would use to write content.

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Everything should be made as simple as possible,
   but not any simpler ---Albert Einstein
   #+END_QUOTE

** Conclusions

   OrgMode is amazing. Collapsing trees, moving them around is also
   possible. OrgBabble is a whole other world of possible actions
   that allow for running code in multiple languages that are available
   on the host of the document.

   Making this document has been really lots of fun to explore what
   is possible.

   Looking forward to more in the Org world.
