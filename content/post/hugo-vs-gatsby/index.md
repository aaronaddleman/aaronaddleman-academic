## ... in the beginning

I grew up writing HTML way back in the early 2000s with the blinking text and animated gifs. JavaScript was used to make ripple effects of images. This was a full pain to manage. Making sure links show up correctly between content. Images in the correct directory. FTP syncing, Dreamweaver, HotDog (editor?), basically a ton of files to manage all over the place. Large sites could not be managed easily because of the number of files involved.

## ... we evolved ...

Fast forward through time and you see lots of things shift to using databases with PHP/popular-language-at-the-time serving up content. 

> Lets shove it all into a database! That will solve all of our problems! Its Friday people! Time go head home. Our job is done here. Whats next?

### mass editing or updating
1. how can this be done?
1. global search and replace might be helpful
